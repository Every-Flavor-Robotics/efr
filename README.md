## Project Objectives
1. **Centralize Tools**: Offer a single CLI entry point for various teams, whether you're working on software dev, video editing, pcb design, or anything else
2. **Extensible Architecture**: Support a robust plugin system, allowing each team to add new commands without touching the core codebase.
3. **Ease of Use**: Offer straightforward commands and a user-friendly help system.

---

## Installation
Below is a quick, one-line terminal command to clone this repository and install **efr**:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Every-Flavor-Robotics/efr/main/install.sh | bash
```

The install script does the following:
1. **Clone** the repository from GitHub.
2. **Move** into the `efr` folder.
3. **Upgrade pip** to the latest version (best practice).
4. **Install** `efr` in editable mode, pulling in any required dependencies.
5. **If** anything fails, it prints an error message and **removes** the cloned folder to leave a clean environment.


### Install in editable mode:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Every-Flavor-Robotics/efr.git
cd efr
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage
Once installed, you can run:
```bash
efr
```
Youâ€™ll see:
- **Tool Information**: Version, a brief description, and usage instructions.
- **Installed Plugins**: A list of plugin commands that are immediately available.

To see detailed help on any subcommand, simply run:
```bash
efr <subcommand> --help
```

## Creating Plugins
One of **efr**â€™s main goals is modular extensibility. Weâ€™ve documented the process in the [plugin_docs.md](https://github.com/Every-Flavor-Robotics/efr/blob/main/plugin_docs.md). Highlights:

1. **Create** a new Python package with a Click command in a file (e.g., `cli.py`).
2. **Register** it under the `efr.plugins` entry point in your `setup.py` (or `pyproject.toml`).
3. **Install** your plugin package, and it appears automatically when you run `efr`.

For a quick start, check out our official [Creating a New **efr** Plugin](https://github.com/Every-Flavor-Robotics/efr/blob/main/plugin_docs.md) guide.
